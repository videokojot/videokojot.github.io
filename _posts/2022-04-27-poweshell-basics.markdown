Powershell was always a bit black box to me, until I watched this nice video series about it, which was really an eye-opener for me. I think for C# dev it is most useful scripting language, because you have access to all of the existing .NET libs + flexibliy of powershell, and now when the Poweshell is running also on linux, it can be used even in containers or for automating of ci pipelines. Much better than bash, at least for me.

I will try to write some notes from the videos. But today, just simple task

``` powershell

```
